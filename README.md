# HTML_CSS_visa_to_the_moon

I done style to the desktop, i have to finish mobile style.

DonÂ´t forget npm install to get node_modules
```
npm install
```

I did a proyect with SASS, so i have a own way to run proyect,
if you use the below way, you can change anything that you want on the html o css sheets.
```
npm run build-css
````
